# Dihybrid Punnett Square Calculator

This is a Dihybrid Punnet Square Calculator it not only serves as a visual guide for mendelian inheritance but also provides the possible genotypic frequencies for a particular offspring, given the know genotypes of its parents.

Remember to only use capital (A / B) for dominant alleles and lower case (a / b) for recessive alleles.

Have fun!
